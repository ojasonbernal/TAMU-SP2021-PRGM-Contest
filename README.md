<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The Aggie Competitive Coding Club at Texas A&M University sponsored the Spring 2021 virtual programming competition. The competition was hosted on codeforces.com and allowed for students to compete in teams with up to 4 individuals. Each of the students were asked technical questions, similar to those found in a technical interview. The time/space complexity of the solutions and number of attempts to a question was used to score how well the student performed. Those competing were then ranked at the end of the competition.

A list of commonly used resources that I found helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With

The problems were attempted/solved using C++ and C++ Standard Template Library.
